# Frame TV Art Generator - Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Current Issue: Bing Image Creator API Changes

### Problem
The Bing Image Creator interface has changed, causing the automated image generation to fail with the error: "Could not extract request ID from response"

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Prompt Generation**: Seasonal prompts are generated correctly
- ‚úÖ **Image Processing**: 4K resize and optimization works perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Frame TV API**: Samsung SmartThings integration is configured
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: Bing cookie authentication is working
- ‚úÖ **Application Structure**: All components and scheduling work properly

### What's Not Working ‚ùå
- ‚ùå **Bing Image Generation**: Automated extraction of images from Bing Create

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions

### Option 1: Manual Image Collection (Immediate Solution)
1. **Generate images manually**:
   - Go to https://www.bing.com/create
   - Use the prompts from the application (found in logs)
   - Download the generated images
   - Place them in `images/generated/` folder

2. **Run processing and upload**:
   ```bash
   # Process existing images and upload to Frame TV
   python -c "
   from src.scheduler import FrameTVArtScheduler
   scheduler = FrameTVArtScheduler()
   scheduler.image_processor.process_batch('images/generated')
   # Upload processed images manually
   "
   ```

### Option 2: Alternative AI Image Services
Replace Bing with other services by updating `src/bing_generator_v2.py`:

#### OpenAI DALL-E 3 (Recommended)
- **Cost**: ~$0.04 per image
- **Quality**: Excellent
- **Reliability**: High
- **Setup**: Get OpenAI API key

#### Stability AI (Stable Diffusion)
- **Cost**: ~$0.002 per image  
- **Quality**: Very Good
- **Reliability**: High
- **Setup**: Get Stability AI API key

#### Local Stable Diffusion
- **Cost**: Free (after setup)
- **Quality**: Good
- **Reliability**: Medium
- **Setup**: Requires powerful GPU

### Option 3: Fix Bing Integration (Advanced)
The Bing interface may have changed to use:
- Different authentication methods
- CSRF tokens
- JavaScript-heavy interfaces
- Captcha protection

## üìã Quick Manual Workflow

### For This Month (June):
1. **Prompts to use manually** (generated by the app):
   - "Create a high-quality artistic image suitable for display as wall art on a large television screen. The image should feature early summer outdoor scenes"
   - "Create a high-quality artistic image suitable for display as wall art on a large television screen. The image should feature graduation-themed inspirational landscapes"
   - "Create a high-quality artistic image suitable for display as wall art on a large television screen. The image should feature bright sunny meadows and fields"
   - "Create a high-quality artistic image suitable for display as wall art on a large television screen. The image should feature wedding-inspired romantic outdoor settings"

2. **Manual Process**:
   - Go to https://www.bing.com/create
   - Enter each prompt
   - Download all 4 generated images
   - Save as: `images/generated/manual_june_1.jpg`, `manual_june_2.jpg`, etc.

3. **Auto-process and upload**:
   ```bash
   cd frame_tv_art_generator
   python -c "
   from src.image_processor import ImageProcessor
   from src.frame_tv_api import SamsungFrameTVAPI
   
   # Process images
   processor = ImageProcessor()
   processed = processor.process_batch('images/generated', 'images/processed')
   
   # Upload to Frame TV (if configured)
   api = SamsungFrameTVAPI()
   api.upload_batch(processed, 'June_Manual')
   "
   ```

## üîß Configuration Status

Based on testing, here's what's set up:

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Bing Cookie | ‚úÖ Configured | Authentication working |
| Samsung Token | ‚úÖ Configured | SmartThings API ready |
| Device ID | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Setup | Replace "YOUR_FRAME_TV_DEVICE_ID_HERE" |
| Base Prompt | ‚úÖ Ready | Customizable art preferences |
| Seasonal Themes | ‚úÖ Ready | 12 months of themes |

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Manual)**:
   - Use Bing Create manually with the generated prompts
   - Process and upload using the working components

2. **Short-term (Alternative API)**:
   - Sign up for OpenAI API
   - Replace Bing generator with DALL-E integration
   - Cost: ~$1-2/month for 25-50 images

3. **Long-term (Monitor Bing)**:
   - Bing may fix their interface or provide stable API
   - Community solutions may emerge
   - Consider web automation tools like Selenium

## üìû Getting Samsung Frame TV Device ID

To complete the setup:

1. **SmartThings App Method**:
   - Open SmartThings app
   - Find your Frame TV
   - Go to device settings
   - Look for device ID

2. **API Method**:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer f76f2aa5-6d81-4817-9109-1232e1688103" \
