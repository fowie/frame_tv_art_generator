No fantasty scenes. and have rich, vibrant colors and fine detail that will look stunning when viewed from across a room. The composition should be balanced and visually appealing with good contrast and depth. Avoid any text, logos, or watermarks in the image.  Images should be in the style of art gallery painting, not photos.  Do not include any frames or external details, just the main painting or scene itself.
